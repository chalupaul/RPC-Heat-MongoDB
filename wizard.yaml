MongoDB
====

short_desc: RPC-Heat-MongoDB delivers a deployable configuration of MongoDB cluster using the Heat orchestration engine available in any Rackspace OpenStack Private Cloud.

long_desc:
MongoDB is open source, document based, database, also classified as “NoSQL”. It utilizes JSON-like structure, making it easy to store entire documents rather than the rows and tables of data compared to relational database. MongoDB solution on Rackspace Private Cloud provides a great general-purpose platform for applications that require large and robust NoSQL database implementation.

architecture:
- The RPC MongoDB solution provides a best practice architecture and solution for running mid-size to large MongoDB clusters configured to run on a typical Private Cloud Configuration.
- Our MongoDB architecture is designed to provide a resilient database to store your content in a Private Cloud. We have optimized every component of the stack for Cloud Infrastructure. With a deployment driven by the OpenStack Heat orchestration engine and Salt configuration management, we are able to deliver MongoDB cluster as a repeatable, scalable, production-ready deployment.

design_specs:
- This template uses MongoDB salt-formulas to configure the servers. Three instances will be Mongo configuration servers, at least two mongo routing (mongos) servers, and at least 3 mongodb shards in a replica set. Each replica set created becomes a shard for databases to spread across.
- For access to nodes in the MongoDB cluster, a floating ip will be assigned to the salt-master. Or a new server can be created in the same network as the MongoDB network. Additionally, mongos server will also be on a separete network so that applications could access your database cluster without being on the same network.
- Any changes to the MongoDB configuration can be done using Salt pillars on the Salt master. Adding additional mongos nodes can be done via Salt as well.

questions:
- keyname: Please select SSH key to be used with the Salt master
- image: Please select image to be used for spinning up every VM in the stack
- floating-network-id: Please select external network
- apps-network: Please select application network
- minion-count-mongos: How many mongos instances to create
- minion-count-replicaset: How many replica sets to create
- minion-size-mongodb: VM Flavor (size) for every VM created
